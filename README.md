# Public_API_Requests
 An app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

 I used Random User Generator API [https://randomuser.me/] to grab information for 12 random "employess"
 and then that data used to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
 
 #### This projects is mainly to show and demonstrate my skills on:
 * Working with Public API's
 * Making API Requests
 * Asynchronously Handling the data using Javascript promises
 
 ####Search feature added:
 Now users can search the employees by typing name in the search field. The list will be filtered if any key is pressed or even by clicking search button provided.
 #### CSS changes made: 
 * body {
     background: #0074D9;
 }
 * header h1 {
     font-size: 2.5em;
     color: rgba(214, 209, 211, 0.85);
 }
 * .card-text {
       font-size: 0.9em;
       color: rgba(60, 127, 235, 0.9);
       }
 * .search-input {
       font-family: 'Inconsolata', monospace;
       background: #2a66dc;
       color: aliceblue;
       box-shadow: 0 0 25px 0 #2a66dc,
           0 20px 25px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
        }

 ## How to Use:
