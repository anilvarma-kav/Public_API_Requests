# Public_API_Requests
 An app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

 I used Random User Generator API [https://randomuser.me/] to grab information for 12 random "employess"
 and then that data used to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
 
 #### This projects is mainly to show and demonstrate my skills on:
 * Working with Public API's
 * Making API Requests
 * Asynchronously Handling the data using Javascript promises
 
 ## How to Use:
 * Clone or download the repository to your computer
 * Open the project root folder and double click on index.html
 * Then the Guess_the_Phrase javascript game will appear on the default browser tab
